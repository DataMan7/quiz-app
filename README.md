# Jua Quiz Game

## Overview
Jua is an engaging, Kahoot-inspired quiz game designed for fun learning and competition. Players answer multiple-choice questions across 4 sets of 5 questions each (20 total per game), earning points based on correct answers and time left. The game supports single-player mode and multi-player (host/join via PIN, with simulated players for testing). Questions are dynamically loaded from a Supabase database for variety, with fallback to static data for offline/resilience.

Key Features:
- **Random Questions**: 100+ questions from diverse topics (Science, History, Geography, Sports, Movies, Riddles, Math, Literature) shuffled for each playthrough.
- **Scoring**: 10 points per second left on correct answer; -5 for wrong, -10 for timeout.
- **Creative UI**: Animated timers, feedback (green/red buttons with pulse/shake), level complete screens with 5s countdown, emoji-rich results.
- **Progression**: 5s creative loading between sets ("Set X Conquered! üöÄ Gear up for Set Y..."); full 20 questions before interactive results.
- **End-Game**: Stop timer, animated leaderboard with medals/performance emojis; manual reset or menu; auto-back to start after 10s inactivity.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel with serverless API; GitHub for version control.
